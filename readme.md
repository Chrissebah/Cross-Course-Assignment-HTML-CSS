# Project Title

    Cross Course Assignment HTML CSS GameHub

## Description

    This is my first year, HTML and CSS assignment. The task is to make a fully functional webpage out of the prototype made in Figma.  
    I am tasked with both learning HTML & CSS and using it to create a deployed website, to show off the skills I have learned.
    The website needs to be responsive on different screen sizes, colorblind friendly and easy to navigate through.

### Deployed Website

## Changes from prototype

Added header and footer for a more professional look. Removed some of the background pictures due to them not looking as good in the final product. Changed layout of buttons on the homepage due to alignment issues when trying to make the website responsive.
