# Project Title

    Cross Course Assignment HTML CSS GameHub

## Description

    This is my first year, HTML and CSS assignment. The task is to make a fully functional webpage out of the prototype made in Figma.  
    I am tasked with both learning HTML & CSS and using it to create a deployed website, to show off the skills I have learned.
    The website needs to be responsive on different screen sizes, colorblind friendly and easy to navigate through.
